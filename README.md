# Campaign Foundry — Creative Automation Pipeline

Turn a **single campaign brief** into on-brand social ad **creatives across every
product and aspect ratio** — with automated brand & legal compliance and a
human-in-the-loop (HITL) approval step before launch.

Built as a proof-of-concept for scalable, localized social ad production: the
creative team supplies a brief (and optional assets), and the pipeline generates,
composites, checks, and organizes every variation automatically.

---

## What it does

Given a campaign brief with **≥2 products**, a **target region**, a **target
audience**, and a **campaign message**, the pipeline:

1. **Validates** the brief (≥2 products, required fields).
2. **Runs a legal gate** on the copy (prohibited-terms check) before spending any
   effort generating assets.
3. **Resolves a background** per product — reuses a provided input asset when one
   exists, otherwise **generates** one.
4. **Composites** the creative for **three aspect ratios** — `1:1` (1080×1080),
   `9:16` (1080×1920), `16:9` (1920×1080) — overlaying the campaign message and
   the product logo with deterministic layering.
5. **Checks brand compliance** (brand-colour density) on each rendered creative.
6. **Saves outputs** organized by product and aspect ratio, plus a print-proof PDF.
7. Surfaces every creative in a **HITL review UI** to approve/reject before launch.

No external API keys are required — it runs **fully offline** by default (see
[Design decisions](#key-design-decisions)).

## Architecture

Hexagonal architecture (**ports & adapters**) in a **modular monolith** — Yarn
workspaces + Turborepo. The domain core has zero infrastructure dependencies;
everything that touches the outside world is an adapter behind a port.

```

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/CampaignOrchestration` | Domain model + `GenerateCampaignUseCase` + the four port contracts |
| `packages/CreativeGeneration` | Background generation + compositing adapters |
| `packages/GovernanceAndCompliance` | Brand-colour + prohibited-words compliance adapter |
| `packages/Distribution` | Filesystem export + print-proof (PDF) adapter |
| `packages/shared` | `Result` kernel and shared primitives |
| `apps/api` | Nitro server: `POST /campaigns/generate` + the composition root |
| `apps/web` | Next.js HITL review interface |

**Stack:** TypeScript · Node 20+ · Yarn 4 + Turborepo · Nitro · Next.js 15 /
React 19 · `@napi-rs/canvas` (compositing, prebuilt — no system libs) · `pdf-lib`
(proofs, pure-JS).

---

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 20+**
- **Yarn 4** via Corepack: `corepack enable`

### Install
```bash
yarn install
cp .env.example .env.local   # defaults work as-is; no external keys needed
```

### Run it — CLI (simplest)
```bash
yarn generate --brief briefs/sample-campaign.yaml
```
Generates every creative into `output/`, prints a run report, and writes proofs.

### Run it — dev servers (API + HITL UI)
```bash
yarn dev
```
- Nitro API → http://localhost:3001 (`POST /campaigns/generate`)
- Next.js HITL UI → http://localhost:3000

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/campaigns/generate \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data @briefs/sample-campaign.json
```

## Example input

```yaml
# briefs/sample-campaign.yaml
id: summer-hydration-2026
targetRegion: DE
targetAudience: Urban outdoor enthusiasts, 25–40
campaignMessage: Stay wild. Stay hydrated.
localizedMessage: Bleib wild. Bleib hydriert.
products:
  - id: acme-hydra-bottle
    name: Hydra Bottle
    primaryColor: "#1473E6"
    logoPath: assets/inputs/hydra-logo.png
  - id: acme-trail-pack
    name: Trail Pack
    primaryColor: "#E0218A"
    logoPath: assets/inputs/trail-logo.png
    inputAsset: assets/inputs/trail-pack.png   # reused when present
```

## Example output

Outputs are organized **by product, then aspect ratio**:

```

│   ├── 9x16.png
│   └── 16x9.png

│   ├── 1x1.png
│   ├── 9x16.png

└── report.json     # per-asset compliance scores + pipeline log
```

## Key design decisions

1. **Hexagonal / ports & adapters.** The domain core (`CampaignOrchestration`)
   depends only on interfaces it owns. Generation, compositing, compliance, and
   export are adapters injected at the app composition root — each swappable
   without touching business logic.
2. **Google Imagen, with an offline fallback.** Hero backgrounds are generated by
   **Google Imagen** (`@google/genai`) behind `ImageGeneratorPort` when
   `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set; otherwise a deterministic procedural adapter (a gradient
   from each product's brand colour) runs **fully offline with zero API keys**, so a
   reviewer can clone and run immediately. On any API error the run falls back to
   procedural — swapping generators is just an env var, no domain change.
3. **Deterministic layer stacking.** Compositing follows a fixed Z-order —
   background → dark contrast gradient (WCAG legibility) → **brand-colour accent
   footer** → centred message → logo top-right — so output is reproducible and
   on-brand every run.
4. **Compliance as a non-throwing circuit breaker.** Checks always return a
   `ComplianceResult`; the *use case* owns the halt decision. The legal gate halts
   the run early; the visual check annotates each asset's `complianceScore`.
   The brand-colour accent footer (decision 3) is what makes this honest: it gives
   every creative a deliberate ~5% brand-colour density — clearing the density gate
   in **both** the Imagen and procedural paths — while the gate stays meaningful, as
   a creative that lost its brand presence would still fall below threshold. Without
   it, photographic GenAI backgrounds carry no brand colour and every asset fails.
5. **Human-in-the-loop approval.** A review surface for approve/reject before
   launch — directly targeting the "slow approval cycles" pain point in the brief.
6. **Modular monolith.** In-process contexts, one repo, one command to run — with
   clean seams to split into services later.

## Assumptions & limitations

- **Image generation** uses **Google Imagen** when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set,
  otherwise an offline procedural gradient — both behind `ImageGeneratorPort`.
- **Proofs are RGB, not colour-managed** — print-accurate CMYK is out of scope.
- **Storage is the local filesystem**, abstracted behind `ExportPort` (a cloud
  storage adapter — S3/Azure/Dropbox — is a drop-in replacement).
- **Localization** falls back to the campaign message when no localized copy is
  supplied; full multi-locale generation is a stretch goal.
- **Compliance heuristics are illustrative** (pixel-density + word-list), not a
  production moderation system.
